# Stage 09 — Feature Engineering

This homework implements **2 engineered features** on the clinical vitals dataset:

- **Shock Index** = Heart Rate ÷ Systolic BP  
- **Respiratory–Oxygen Ratio** = Respiratory Rate ÷ Oxygen Saturation  

Each feature includes:  
- Implementation code  
- Markdown rationale  
- Correlation / visualization with the target variable `Risk_Level`  

The work is saved in:
