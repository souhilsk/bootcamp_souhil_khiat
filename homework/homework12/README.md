Final Report: Forecasting Model Analysis
This folder contains the final deliverable for the Stage 12 analysis.

Chosen Audience and Rationale
Audience: A non-technical business stakeholder, such as a Portfolio Manager or Head of Strategy.
Rationale: This audience needs clear, decision-oriented insights, not a deep dive into the technical methodology. They are primarily concerned with the final numbers, the level of confidence in those numbers, and the key risks or opportunities that the analysis has uncovered.
Format Rationale
Format: A 5-slide presentation deck.
Why this format fits: A concise slide deck is the ideal format for this audience. It forces the narrative to be focused and hierarchical, starting with a high-level executive summary and then supporting it with key visuals and takeaways. This structure respects the stakeholder's limited time and makes the recommendations easy to understand and act upon. The exported charts are included in the /images subfolder.
